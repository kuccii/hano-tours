Made in Rwanda Fashion
Fashion & Style
Though it would have been a pipe dream some years ago, today Kigali is cosmopolitan enough to host not one, but two fashion festivals every year, and for fashionistas and those on the cutting edge of style, they offer a fantastic opportunity to see the cultural fusion of western and Rwandan styles that the country’s finest designers negotiate and create daily. Kigali Fashion Week takes place every July, and hosts dozens of international, local, and upcoming young designers, while the Rwanda Cultural Fashion Week showcases even more local and international talent every September.

At the back live a few long-horned Inyambo cattle, descended from the king's herd, whose keepers carefully tend and sing to them, keeping alive a unique tradition.
