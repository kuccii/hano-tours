Tea
Tea was introduced in Rwanda in 1952 and is now one of the country’s largest exports. The fertile volcanic soil and temperate climate make for perfect tea growing conditions. A number of tea factories are open to the public, enabling visitors to discover how tea is harvested and processed.

Rwanda is an up-and-coming safari destination, with central Africa's largest protected wetland in the Akagera National Park on the country's eastern border with Tanzania. Following the reintroduction of lions and rhinos, it is now home to the Big Five.

Rwanda has one of the highest bird counts on the continent despite being one of the smallest countries in Africa. The prime birdwatching destinations are Nyungwe and Akagera National Parks, although enchanting sightings are common across the country.

Gorilla Tracking
The unique opportunity to see gorillas in their natural habitat is unforgettable, some even say life changing. Encounters with gorillas as they go about their daily lives are carefully managed, with expert trackers and guides leading small groups of tourists up bamboo-covered slopes to spend a precious and awe-inspiring hour just a few feet away from the gentle creatures.

Coffee
A patchwork of 450,000 small growers produce coffee all across Rwanda, but visits are primarily centred around Gisenyi, near the shores of Lake Kivu. Some farmers’ cooperatives and washing stations offer tours explaining the coffee process through the year.
