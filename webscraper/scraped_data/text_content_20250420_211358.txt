Volcanoes National Park
“In the heart of Central Africa, so high up that you shiver more than you sweat,” wrote the eminent primatologist Dian Fossey, “are great, old volcanoes towering almost 15,000 feet, and nearly covered with rich, green rainforest – the Virungas.”
The Volcanoes National Park fall on one side of the Virunga Massif, home to mountain gorillas, golden monkeys and much more.
