Volcanoes National Park
Volcanoes National Park
“In the heart of Central Africa, so high up that you shiver more than you sweat,”
wrote the eminent primatologist Dian Fossey
, “are great, old volcanoes towering almost 15,000 feet, and nearly covered with rich, green rainforest – the Virungas.”
Situated in the far northwest of Rwanda, Volcanoes National Park protects the steep slopes of this magnificent mountain range – home of the endangered mountain gorilla and a rich mosaic of montane ecosystems, which embrace evergreen and bamboo forest, open grassland, swamp and heath.
Volcanoes National Park is named after the chain of dormant volcanoes making up the Virunga Massif: Karisimbi – the highest at 4,507m, Bisoke with its verdant crater lake, Sabinyo, Gahinga and Muhabura.
Tracking endangered
mountain gorillas
through the mysterious intimacy of the rain forest, alive with the calls of 200 species of colorful
birds
and chattering of the rare
golden monkey
, is only one of the truly unique experiences in the area.

Within the boundaries of Volcanoes National Park are Buhanga Eco-Park, an ancient forest holding Rwanda’s most intriguing folklore and
Musanze Caves
, formed 62 million years ago after the last estimated volcanic eruption.
Hiking
,
canoeing
,
mountain biking
and village experiences offer something for everyone to enjoy.
